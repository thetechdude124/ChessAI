1. 🌐 Developed a **Minimax algorithm** to generate all possible moves given a set of tensors derived from a chess board.
2. 🤖 Implemented a **deep CNN to predict scores** of Minimax-generated ranks using starter code from Digital Secrets.
3. ⛎ Built a **custom player interface** that allowed the user to play against the algorithm using Python and PyGame, as well as **unique chess codes** to allow for a seamless playing experience. 

Hope you find this (and the article) exciting and engaging!
